- delete everything from this chef repo that fabric doesn't move over

- .bashrc for install user and mapr user, not just root

- parse check on cluster.json before executing anything fabric or manifests.py related.

- start zk, wait for success, then start cldb (warden), wait for success, then start warden on other nodes

- add 'fc' permissions to mapr user

- install clush on installer node, with proper groups & sudo

- passwd on mapr user (only webserver?  or all nodes?)

- sshd_config ... add mapr to AllowGroups
